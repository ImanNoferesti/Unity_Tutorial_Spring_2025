// 1. Syntax and Declaring Variables
/*
  * Write a program to declare variables for your name, age, and a decimal value for your height in meters or inches.
  * Print them out in a single sentence.
*/

string name = "Iman";
int age = 29;
float height = 1.93f;

Console.WriteLine($"My name is {name}, and I'm {age} years old and {height} meters tall.");


// 2. Display Variables and Declare Multiple Variables
// Declare three integers (x, y, z) on a single line, assign values to them, and display their sum.






// 3. Min and Max Values
// Write a program that displays the minimum and maximum values for int and double data types.






// 4. Strings
/*
*  Write a program that asks the user for their first name and last name.
*  Print the length of their first name.
*  Concatenate the user's first name and last name and display the full name.
*  Print the user's initials using the full name
*/







// 5. Arithmetic and Assignment Operators
/*
* Create a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two numbers.
* Use assignment operators.
*/

 
 
 

 
// 6. If-else statements and Logical Operators
/*
* Ask the user to enter their age and if they have a driving license (true/false).
* Check if the user is old enough to drive (at least 18 years old) and has a license.
* Use logical AND and OR operators to handle different cases.
*/
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
// 7. Switch Statement
/*
* Write a program that asks the user to input a number between 1 and 10.
* Use a switch statement to show if the user input is divisible by 5.
* Print a message if the input number is divisible.
* If the input is invalid, display " Invalid number."

// 8. While loop
// Write a program to print all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a while loop.

  
  
  

  
// 9. Do-While loop
/*
* Create a program that asks the user for a password in a do-while loop and continues to prompt until they enter "1234"
*
* Sample Input/Output:
*    Enter the password: 0000
*    Wrong password, try again.
*    Enter the password: 1234
*    Access granted!
